Student Name: Erdem Inmez

1.	Introduction

  Purpose of the app is to create a mobile platform to help lost pets and their owners. The target audience of the app is people who lost their pets and people who saw or collected a lost pet. People who lost their pets can share a post on the app which gives information about the lost pet and its disappearance. These posts will be listed in the app so that the people who wants to help can look this list and could contribute to finding the lost pet. Basically, there will be one post sharing screen and one post list in the app. 
  The location of disappearance of the lost pet will be displayed on map when a disappearance post in list is clicked, for this iOS location services will be used. 
  All the posts will be stored in Firebase Firestore database so that each user can access the lists of the post on cloud.
  Lost pet alert should be quick and efficient so there will be no user account. That mean anyone who has the app could directly share or view posts without creating or log into any account.
  There will be a search screen to only list the posts in desired city, country. Also you will be able to choose desired animal type.

  All the work will be completed by Erdem Inmez.
